# IT Helpdesk Job Scripts & Programs

---

Hello! This is a GitHub repository containing all of scripts and programs that I developed during my time as an
IT Helpdesk Specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Chemistry.

These are real, reliable scripts that have been used on the job by the Helpdesk, so feel free to use or fork them!

All of these are under the UW-Madison Apache Software License.

To see the original projects in the official IT Chem Help Desk GitLab, please visit [https://git.doit.wisc.edu/chemistryithelpdesk](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/chemistryithelpdesk)

If you are internal (have a *wisc.edu* email address), you can see the internal version of these projects.
